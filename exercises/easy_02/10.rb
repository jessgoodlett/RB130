# In the previous exercise, we wrote a method that emulates Enumerable#each_cons, but limited our method to handling 2 elements at a time. Enumerable#each_cons can actually handle any number of elements at a time: 1, 2, 3, or more.

# Update your each_cons method so it takes an argument that specifies how many elements should be processed at a time.
